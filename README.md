# Give me my Temperature

This is a small POC to show how we can get Locations from `react-native-google-places-autocomplete` and then consult a `OpenWeather API` to get the real weather information dynamically.

You can check an Android demo from https://expo.io/@ajd01/givemetemperature. You just need to download the expo app and read the QR code or you can click on `Open project in the browser` button.

Here is a screen shot:
